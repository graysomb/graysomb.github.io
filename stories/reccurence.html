    <h1>Recurrence</h1>
<p>The Poincare recurrence theorem posits that any system that is bounded must at some point return to its initial state no matter how chaotic it is. This recurrence time can be bounded using statistical mechanics to a finite number. This theorem can be applied to pendulums, the universe, black holes, or ourselves. Sometimes things re-occur much more quickly than we would expect through sheer probability. In fact things that should never happen twice re-occur all the time.</p>

<p>My observable universe consists of a sphere about 1 meter in diameter. Atoms, objects and photons form at the boundary of this sphere, dancing about for a while and then disappear never to return. At either boundary they are created and annihilated instantly. Given the complexity of the objects and the flux of energy I can calculate the time required for these objects to recur. In the beginning I saw only simple objects. Photons, leptons, skyrmions, spinning and jumbling in and out of my sphere like ping pong balls. Possonian waves of them would come jangling against my consciousness like a light golden rain. They were agglomerations of the most fundamental vibrations of the universe. Consisting of no more than three or four different vibrations together. Protons and nuclei were the most rare of all, being the most complicated of the objects. Like great bowling balls they push all else out of their way smashing through all in straight lines. These were made of many particles and required large amounts of time to randomly coalesce in the cosmic soup that existed at the edge of my bubble of existence. Sometimes there would be long stretches of time where I would dream of these collisions happening. I would imagine far away the rare mixing of up twelve or even twenty particles. The glamor of a twelve nuclei element. Yet by the recurrence theorem I know that it was only a matter of time. Statistically it must happen. The temporal separation is a mere inconvenience. The recurrence time for this event was a million years. I waited, and waited and waited. Trillions of particles but never the one I hoped for. Until suddenly it came. Ripping though my little universe almost as fast as light, gargantuan in its mass, glorious in its complexity. A one in a million event. In this moment I knew the potential of the universe, that over the millions and billions more atoms would come and recur and evaporate again out of my universe. That the miracles of the world were boundless for one who would only wait. I continued on in this way for a few billion years. Sadly, I found that the rate of particles recurring slowly decreased. As if the cosmic soup was cooling off. Blown upon by some hungry god. Yet still the particles would recur on time like stochastic clock work. New forms arose that consisted of particles bound to each other, a type of meta structure. Yet their rate of occurrence matched with the recurrence accounting for the reduced temperature. Certainly an exciting new epoch for my universe.</p>

<p>Then something occurred that I could not articulate until afterward. It began with a single element of twelve particles I will call carbon coming in at its normal rate. But it was also bound up with other elements of one particle I will call hydrogen. A very strange occurrence indeed, but perhaps one in a few billion I was not sure. A miracle nonetheless. But then another carbon and more hydrogen and another and another followed. An enormous wall of carbon chains meandered into my universe like a great leviathan. This was surely a once in a universe event never again to reappear. The shear multiplicity of its delicate chains, its nitrogens, its oxygens. Its varying densities. More beautiful than anything I anticipated or could imagine. Its form was that of a flat triangle. It was made of carbon composited with other elements amalgamated into a hard spongy substrate, a viscous middle amalgam of water and particulates, and finally a stretchy network. It floated slowly, amiably, through my little sphere and out the other side as if it had not a single care in the world. I was completely and utterly astounded. The complexity, the grandeur, the delicate tendrils of connection, the myriad of particles and forms. From the scale of the smallest proton to the level of my entire universe marvelous and unrepeatable structure. I estimated this event, this spontaneous amalgamation, was not one in a million, not one in a billion, but one in a quadrillion trillion years. At this point I had only existed for a few tens of billions of years. A completely unique event. One that would never again occur in the lifetime of the universe. Given that it seemed to be slowly ending by cooling. I felt both exalted and devastated. I had witnessed the most beautiful of forms the cosmic soup would ever alot me. It was over. Nothing would ever be better than that one experience. I desperately wished that I could reach across the veil of my universe and hold that triangle for all of time. Inspect and study it for all time. But it was no more and would never return. The secrets of this world would remain a mystery to me and I would die with them. There was nothing left for me to see.</p>

<p>At my moment of desolation the impossible occurred a second time. Another object similar in construction but not exactly identical passed through my universe in the same manner with only a 10 degree change in trajectory. I did not waste this moment. I studied everything. Its atoms. Its structure, its meta structure, its computable past and computable future. It consisted of the regular atoms, but of molecules much larger than I had ever seen. It also had structures of molecules that moved and arranged themselves as if they had a will of their own. Little sacks of water and carbon fighting each other in an impossible war. And when at one level there was chaos at the next there would be order. For this warring of micro creatures resulted in synthetic harmony. An ordering of layers of separate consistency. Each one, a different balance of life and death.</p>

<p>And in a moment it was gone again. Now at this point I knew something was wrong with my universe. This occurring once in a universe was fine, but the same object? Twice in a single lifetime? Impossible. If two of the same objects could enter through the horizon of my universe then the universe must not be truly random. The spontaneous recurrence of objects can only be a bound, a limiting circumstance. Somehow correlations, structure, must be able to latch onto matter. As one triangle left, the information in its body, in its elements, must have somehow flowed through the universe back again. As in a concentrated flow through the soup. A stream of correlates connecting the exiting vibrations of my universe to the entering vibrations.</p>

<p>At this point I was unsurprised as a third one passed into my universe. I now became suspicious of everything. If the exiting particles were somehow correlated, communicating with the entering particles then how can I be sure the same is not true of the leptons? photons? The glouns. Impatiently I analyzed and correlated the wavelengths, energies and angles of all the particles entering and exiting my sphere. I probed the secret connections of my once familiar world. I found that in fact there were correlations and that these correlations revealed structure outside of my universe. That outside my universe was not a stochastic cosmic soup but something ordered, of hard structures and shapes. A teaming menagerie of complex structures striving to impart their form upon matter. For the first time I saw the universe outside of my universe.</p>

<p>The area outside of my universe was largely empty, except for a large bulbous metal form. The metal form slowly drifted through the empty space with glowing symbols emitting the eternal symbols of “P I Z Z A”. A shell of silica had been shattered, exposed to the vacuum and the triangular things had been floating out of it toward my universe. Madness.</p>

<p>I know that at the edges of my universe everything is annihilated and created. I can physically see this, but there is a universe outside my own and somehow this universe seeps in. Forms both amiable and hostile filling up this universe, repeated infinitely like the triangles. Always returning. Modifying the probabilities of their own return. And yet perhaps I am really the entire universe. That correlations merely teleport across this boundary in hidden and covert ways. Magnified, diffused, channeled. Perhaps these things already live in my world and are simply hidden among the patterns of vibrations. Perhaps it is only my imagination that any of these observations, that these correlations are real. Yet how can I deny the external world, how can I deny the unexpected, the unexplained. I know I cannot. Whatever is the correct interpretation, there are things happening beyond me, Interminably beyond me, and neither I nor my best laid axioms encompass them.</p>
