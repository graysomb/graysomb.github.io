    <h1>Crab Fishing</h1>
    <p>In the reeds beyond the crystal foam I wait. Fear is nothing when hunger's bitter truths wait in the night. I am the hunter and the hunted. My claws are strong, the day is bright, and the water is clear. I burble the secret oaths and spells of my people. Preparing for the moment to strike. Fish swim by unable to penetrate my darkness. The eyes of fear see only the present. Silver, blue, yellow, colors beyond imagination swim and dance before me. Sometimes I wish that I did not need to kill them, but it is the way.</p>

    <p>Something then happens that has never happened before. A thing of flesh falls right before me. A carcass of such exquisite smells and flavors my senses are driven beyond heights. Ecstasy cannot repeat itself. Visions of flight, of glowing heat, of black sands, and all manner of unknowable things flood my mind. I carefully inch towards it. It's presence, growing stronger as I approach. Surely with this flesh, with it's potencies, I could be eternal. I could read the visions and know them. Its eternal flesh could feed not just myself, but a hundred crabs. No more hunger, no more strife, peace everlasting. Crab need not kill crab. The desire reaches its height as I grasp it with all my might. The moment I touch the holy flesh I am ripped from my place. The sand and reeds whirl about me. I am pulled ever fast further into the foaming and reeling. Fear grips me, but I hold fast. What is death in the face of life eternal. What is one life for a hundred. I am ripped into the air. My lungs dry and rasp.  Crystals form in my joints. I hang levitated infront of what can only be a creature of cosmic power. I look in horror at the face of my god. He is as large as a hundred crabs. His body, soft and grotesque. He looks at me with an abyssal gaze and laughs. The laugh is feverish and excited. It shakes my ichor. With incrab force he rips me from my prize and casts me through the air. </p>

    <p>What madness is the world. I had it within the tips of my claw. Everything, eternity, but bait for the ignorant. I see the colors of the unknown word spin about me. I await the death that this vertigo will end with. </p>

    <p>I crash through the barrier, back into the warm depths. Astonished, relieved and confused I drift to the bottom. I had seen salvation, I had seen gods, I had seen death, and yet I lived. Nuaght has changed, but that which is inside this shell. An inner molting, that leaves no visible skeleton. Beyond the crystal foam there still stands my gods. Their forms, their motions, blurred and melted by the barrier. I had seen the twisting of these shapes my whole life and never knew. I have gained and lost something infinite. An innocence. My claws are strong, but not strong enough. Perhaps a day will come when a crab will reach through the crystal barrier and rip the eternal flesh from the gods, but it is not this day. It is not this crab. I scuttle back to my reeds, chew the algae at my feet, and dream of bait for a god.
