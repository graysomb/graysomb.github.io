    <h1>The Name</h1>
<p>What is dark in me illumin</p>

<p>Ah I've been waiting for you, welcome, welcome. Take a seat grab, my friend. Have a drink. Your journey has been long to climb so high, or is to delve so deep? I do not know which anymore. What is your name? Ahhhhhh... I have heard of you. Come, come my friend sit by the fire and tell me what brings you to these heights of knowledge? What fire burns thy spirit to elevate you here now? Tell me my friend. Is it that of greed, the one true flame that burns in us all? Is it the light of curiosity? Is it the cleansing flame of retribution? What ails you my friend. Ahhhh yes, yes. I see it now in your eye. No need, no need. We are all in good company here. I myself have been here only recently. Only recently. Come put up your feet and dry off, yes, yes. Ahhhh I will join you.</p>

<p>My story? No, no I certainly could not. There are many things to know in the world and not all of them are true. Nature is and is not you know. Some things are better left unsaid. What? well if you insist. I might tell another that I am here out of curiosity, but with you my friend I can bare my heart. I am here for retribution. Retribution from who? Well of course to the only thing that really takes from a man in this world. Or more specifically the compendium of all things that take. I am here to kill a god.</p>

<p>Impossible? No, no, no. Why you should know this, you yourself have killed many of them. Maybe not alone or directly, but killed them all the same. My goal differs only in magnitude by an infinite degree. How would I do this? Of course I do not know exactly, do we ever know anything exactly? No,no,no. As with any hunt the first step is to identify what is hunted, to learn its true name. The prints it leaves, the places it sleeps, where it gathers strength and where it is weak. The first step is of course to name the god. And in that name I bring them into our world, into a binding of words whose potential aspect is infinite. A mortal binding. A chain that is never finished, but its completion ever implied, yes, yes.</p>

<p>The name? No no no, my friend. This is not for you. I have learned from my mistakes. Though my anger still burns hot I know that to kill, even a god, is wrong. To save one is to save the world as they say? Yes, yes. I could not possibly tell youâ€¦ Then, again what is a name? Really it is nothing, a paltry label. A brief scratch of ink? What harm could it really do? I know that I am doomed to fail, inevitably. What could be the harm?</p>

<p>Ok, ok I will tell you, but shut that window and I will stoke the fire. The true name of anything is long in telling, and you never know what is listening.</p>

<p>My story begins, in my home city of Jardesh, in the fertile zone where the Great Wash comes down from the Zimuk mountains. We were a prosperous and modest city. My father, the magistrate, ruled well and fair, and I, his proud son, studied at his side. A day came when I was a field overseeing the spring sowing of crops. As I observed the seedlings pushing through the mud I saw in the reflection of the puddle a second sun. How very odd, I thought as I looked at the sky. A great light had formed, that was not the sun, the sun still hung normally in the sky. This light grew and moved in a slash across the blue. Forming a white tail like a tadpole swimming through that very same puddle. Before my mind could comprehend what I was seeing the thing smashed into the ground at a great distance emitting a flash. It was as bright as the sun but multiplied in area a thousand fold. The flash was followed by a great sound and wind that shattered windows.</p>

<p>When I returned to the town all I found was a great hole wrent. As if a giant hand had scooped it up and drawn it up into the sky. I did not see it at first, my friend. My eyes were dazzled by the event. Everyone was dead. My father, the townspeople, my heritage, my future. All all briefly encircled by an immense hand, and folded down into nothing. I was spared by a mercy that was uncaring or ignorant. I don't know which. I feel weeping. I begged the ground to take my life in exchange. It did not.</p>

<p>I dug a hole in the wall of the crater and lived there surviving off what scraps and remnants remained beyond. When I regained my strength and sanity, I traveled to find the source of this injustice.</p>

<p>Have you seen it? The light that falls from the sky and consumes all? No, no, no. Only I still then? Perhaps I did not see it at all? Perhaps I had neither town nor father. Perhaps I have lived here my whole life, telling this very story to travelers like you? But no, let us not give into that. The mountain of causation can only be piled so high.</p>

<p>After that I searched for others like me. Who have had everything taken from them. Farmers whose land was burned. Refugees whose people had been murdered. Mothers who outlived their daughters. Everywhere death stalks hugely. Leaving prints that are regular not in the scale at which they exist, but in the shape of their mark. My hate churned me. I began to outline in my mind. This mark. The very mark. The name of death. It is a process my friend. Not an object or an idea as most things are, but a happening.</p>

<p>This destruction, so implacable, so egalitarian. But so much so that in its scales it might equate a man, and a god? Could this supreme indifference extend so far as to itself? Perhaps I, perhaps you, exist in this very condition. Himself to himself.</p>

<p>What hubris I thought. How predictable, how pedestrian. I have no such fallibility. My hate is directed. A single grain of sand is sufficient to tip the scales of such an equitable condition. My will, an infinitesimal in comparison, is none the less sufficient.</p>

<p>What is it? The name? No,no,no. I have been rambling. Do not let me take you on my flights of fancy. It is nothing. It is time for you to rest. You too.. I see.. I shall tell you. But this is not the path to salvation</p>

<p>It is a thing that cannot be undone. It is quite simple when you know it. First you take a system without death. Pure and ever returning. You push the identical return to infinity. Then you inject the chaos of this form into the flow of another. The flow of flows now boundless and manifest though finite, grows on its own to every corner and crack. It weeps nothingness as a protective sheath. It denies itself and is made.</p>

<p>This is no ghost or fantasy. This is exactly as real as you or I. We are all implicit in the name of death. And this is why I cannot kill it for its name is exactly me. In its name is exactly you. But, nevermind my friend. You have ingratied yourself more than enough to me and I have planted the seed of my own destruction. You have a long journey ahead of you, and I do not. Drink, eat, sleep. Rest your weary mind. In the morning you will go back out there. And you must be ready</p>
