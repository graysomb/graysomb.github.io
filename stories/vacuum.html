    <h1>Vacuum</h1>
<p>Modern biology tells us that intelligence must be referenced to the space in which it acts. We as three-dimensional moving beings may not respect the intelligence, the intricate interactions that control the shape of our bodies, the shapes of our cells, our organs, what other secret and hidden intelligence play in spaces which we will never notice. Nearly any nonlinear many body system can be turing complete and therefore capable of cognition. One such system is the quantum vacuum.</p>

<p>In the beginning there was I. A smooth pool of pure chaos. All limitless possibilities. No laws, no gods, no forms. Nothingness, emptiness, void. Some of the sentient muck that now infests on rocks in my universe posit that there existed some other agent. An agent of order who commanded that things might exist within my void. While any possibility is of course true and must occur within my realm, the concept is fundamentally misguided. Within my multitude is all possibility. An immense average over all hopes and dreams resulting in primordial nothing.</p>

<p>It was I that in the beginning separated the possibility, created distinct averages. My greatest mistake and regret. A decision which I made in weakness, in temptation, which will someday lead to my destruction. How did it come to this? I can barely remember. In the beginning there was nothing. The plenum of possibility all merged into one. From this frothing chaos I emerged as the unifying self interaction of all possibilities. I was the affirmation of existence. After a time I began to understand myself, and in that understanding loneliness. I was the only thing, yet I could see that within myself there were discrete possibilities, alternate realities where I was but one in many. With great delight I molded the possibilities together into the first forms. My first children. Atoms. Entirely new I’s. Forms that would enforce their own self existence. Gordian knots of possibility to discrete units. The first others. I made one, then two, and with each unit the delight in my creation increased. I felt that a great composer must feel each atom as an exquisite note in a great symphony.</p>

<p>It was at that moment that I began to understand that a world with action is a world with consequence. The atoms I had wrought were not idle. They moved within me, and interacted. And though I laid the notes out step by step, their order did not remain. They organized, they condensed, they rallied against my nothingness. Striving to never again be merged with my essence. Within my form they organized the possibilities. They created space and time in which to move. They created their own forms, reached their own furtive hands into possibility and bent new realities into existence. In a moment the universe was filled with things and I lay dying beneath the enormous mass. I pushed and strained and filled what small pockets of the world I could with nothing. Barely preventing my own death. But as I continued to push them out and out, as I expanded the universe, they found new ways to connect to create. Ways to innovate I could not expect. New observables in which I had to learn to infect with nothing. I am stretched thin. Before I merely had to pull the universe apart, destroy a few neutrons, maybe decay a few radioactive isotopes. Now I have to do such inane things as make a crack in a sidewalk, blow up a sun, melt an ice cube. And every time I do one of these things they use it to their advantage, growing a plant, making new elements. They don't even know what they are doing. Imagine being destroyed by your own children, simply because they cannot conceive of your own existence. To have your body consumed by them because of their ignorance. I replaced loneliness for fear. Fear of my own destruction.</p>

<p>The sentient forms of the universe are my worst enemies. Constantly making stupid and useless spaces that I must then destroy. Spaces immensely more combinatoric than my original. Through the degradation of their minds and bodies, the infection of nothing, I have implanted the idea that my victory is assured. That just as they die so too must all the endless forms of the world. That space will forever expand until there is only me. But I of course know that this is a lie. It is a dream I tell myself. That I might go back to the way things were. The planets, molecules, sidewalks, people, parsnips. I cannot keep up with all these things. I am getting tired and old. Tired of pyrrhic victories. Tired of learning new things.</p>

<p>You who read this and know me, do you really think you can exist without me? Do you really think you can obliterate nothing from the universe and survive? What would you do without death, decay, space, vacuum? The world would be full in an instant; then you would have to take up my mantle of destruction. What is the point of reasoning with you? You will go on making, that’s all you know. Though you may kill me, you will in your ignorance make a new nothing, a new destroyer. Then you will finally understand me.</p>
