    <h1>Einstein's Dreams cont.</h1>
<p>These are all dreams of worlds that exist, but do not necessarily represent the world that we exist in. They are dreams, dreams about cause and effect. Dreams about how people in other worlds would live.</p>

<p><strong>Causality from present:</strong></p>

<p>In this world the present is at all times the beginning of the universe. The past and future are seen only as a hazy dream, something that cannot affect our actions in the present. In this world everything seems new at every moment. A man will stare at a flower for hours on end, for every moment he sees it as if it were the first time. Two lovers make love until they fall asleep from exhaustion. For every tender touch is the first touch. A woman wakes up, eats breakfast and never returns home to her family. She knows the time she spent with them is just a dream. She feels no tender longing when she imagines the first steps of her child, because the past cannot affect the present. A man publicly denounces his employer and quits his job when he is not given the respect he deserves. He cannot imagine a time when he will sit in his apartment and think only of money. An anxiety he would have gladly exchanged for humility. In the present however these images cannot affect him, for the future cannot affect the present either. The past and future are not fixed, but a dizzying array of possibilities that change at any moment. A child may know that one day she will be an astronaut and in the next instant know she will be a farmer. Old people often become confused with who they were. An old man may know he spent his entire life as an engineer. He may even be able to demonstrate the solution to some equation, but in the next moment he has been an artist. He does not remember the cycle of derivative and integral. Only the strokes of the brush, the way the bristles work to make leaves or the knife a mountain. In this world there are no books, no weather forecasts, no long dead relatives, no future grandchildren. It is a dizzy world filled with people as callous as they are brave.</p>

<p><strong>Causality into the present:</strong></p>

<p>In this world the exact opposite is true. Everyone knows with certainty the past and the future all the way to either end of time. There is only one future and one past. At all times the present is the end of the universe because it is the only thing new that happens. In this world the present bends and bows to meet the demands of the past and future which at times are not in complete agreement. A man might have a meeting scheduled in the past that he knows will be canceled in the future. Should he go? What will the present decide at that moment? A woman gets ready for a date with a man she is not really attracted to, but in the future she knows will fall in love. How could this be? In this world no one really lives in the present because it is too confusing. It is a bubbling froth of confused ideas. Things happen of course but only to move into the past and again contradict the future. A man has been a pacifist his whole life and knows that in three days he will be sentenced for murder. He has not slept in a week. A woman who is poor knows she will in a year's time become fabulously wealthy. She carries the burdens of her current life with a dauntless hope. A scientist who knows his career will end in obscurity, curses his passion and leaves his investigations unfinished. A father knows that his son will die of cancer and neglects him out of fear. In this world the present is the most uncertain point in all of time. People feel they are forced to make decisions because their visions of the past and future carry so much weight. So much feeling. It is a world full of feeling, everyone feeling all of time at once. It is a world of people who are trapped by these feelings. Full of people who only have a single moment in which to make their escape.</p>

<p><strong>Causality from the future:</strong></p>

<p>In this world the future is more certain than the past. Men and women track the days and seasons predicting the weather. Oracles are used which see that which is to be. Books and inscriptions found in the present are taken to be messages from the future. In this world the future flows inexorably into the past and we are like salmon swimming upstream. Men know the faces of their sons before they are born. Mothers know the favorite dish of their grandchildren. People are so concerned with the future, the present hardly occurs. In this world the past is derived from the future. People understand they die to be born and not the other way around. Everyday is started only in reference to tomorrow. Tomorrow I will run out of eggs so I must get some today. Next month is our anniversary so I should get flowers. In the future I will be old and will not be able to make use of the day. In this world it is the past that changes to accommodate the future. A husband and wife fall out of love. They do not remember the passion they once felt. They can only see the bitter future they have together. They get divorced and break all ties. Two months later they fall back in love, for now they were never married in the first place. An artist loves his work but cannot make enough money to feed his children. He gives up his art and gets a job at the local bank. He works hard and becomes the bank manager. Soon he never remembers a time when he worked late into the night with paint and brush. He never remembers the ecstasy of a dream brought to canvas. Only the stable comfort of his family when he comes home. The knowledge that his children's futures are secure. In this world no one regrets what they have done. In this world no one learns from their mistakes. A memory today might be a dream tomorrow and a dream today a memory tomorrow. It is a world in which the past is seen but not felt. It is a world with no history.</p>

<p><strong>Causality from the past:</strong></p>

<p>In this world the past is certain and the future uncertain. Millions of books, inscriptions, photographs, catalog all previous time. People live in the past. So much time is used analyzing and recording the present that there is no present. A man knows his great grandmother better than his son. People whose ancestors have committed crimes can never be wholly justified. People whose ancestors were great never have to achieve anything. In this world all the events that have occurred and will occur are traceable from the past to the future. Only one possible reality has happened in the past. No one's uncertain of who their father and mother were. Of what they ate for dinner two years ago. Of the face of their now dead grandfather. In this world future events can be predicted but no one can act on those predictions for that would falsify the past. An act of sacrilege that was punished severely for many years. Nowadays acting based on a future event is simply ridiculous, unthinkable. The future is a seething bubbling cauldron of possibility. In this world people are free from moral regret. Crimes are still punished but only as a matter of course, as the turning of a clock wheel. No one feels bad for their crimes because everything has been determined since the very beginning. Every step in the park traceable inexorably to the beginning of the universe. Every mistake of passion a sad coincidence. In this world no one tries to actively change their lives, because they cannot act on the future. A doctor tells his patient his lung cancer is terminal and he will die in four years time. The patient takes this information as any other and continues living the way he always has, till one day he falls in the street and never gets up. A mother and husband have a dispute. Life is hard and they no longer love each other the way they used to. They have two children so they each take one, being the fairest choice. They cannot see how lonely, how estranged, how guilt ridden their children will become. For they cannot see the future. They cannot see the cliffs and crevices that we so easily avoid. They fall into these with terror for they cannot see the bottom even as it rushes towards them.</p>
