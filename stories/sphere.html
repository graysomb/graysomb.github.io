    <h1>Stories from the Sphere</h1>
<p>These are short stories that take place on the interior of a dyson sphere in our solar system. Civilization has decayed after a war broke out before the sphere was finished.</p>

<p>The world is vaster than we can comprehend. Infinite in its expanse. Eternally returning in its vastness. Were I to walk the holy road the whole of my life I would not move but an inch. 2 and a half thousand years my people have traveled this road. They have traveled through heresy, through subjugation, through persecution. And yet always the wheel has turned. Always we have walked on. It is said that though the world moves underneath our feet, it too moves around the sun. perhaps we have not moved at all. Perhaps our effects have merely maintained our position in the universe. It does not matter. The universe is no larger than the road we walk, and no smaller than the number of grains of sand. Our journey is not an effort to subjugate distance, not an effort to make the world smaller. It is a way of seeing every point, every minutea, of grasping the ungraspable. It is the effort of walking even though I will fall to the dust long before my journey is over. It is said the world is 90 million miles in circumference and that after 2.6 thousand years of walking my people shall return to the point where the journey began. But I know the truth, the journey had no beginning and no end.</p>

<p>-Priest of the Belt</p>

<p>Only a small portion of the sphere is made up of habitable surface, though this area is far vaster than we could ever imagine to inhabit. Thousands of times larger than any of the planets that existed before the belt. The rest does not support the rotation for gravitational force to be imparted. Of course it is inhabited, but this is merely because habitation is not preventable. I have spent my life studying the form and construction of these areas. I have spent my life in isolation. I have spent my life in wild and uncanny places. Low gravity forests taller than imagination. Floating seas, consisting of planetoids of water. I have spent my life in the effort of obtaining the unknowable secrets of the sphere. I have understood but one thing. The sphere is moving. The energy from the poles is not directed symmetrically but in a single direction. If the laws of the world hold beyond the sphere it will move. Where are we going?</p>

<p>-Pole Surveyor</p>

<p>I have lived longer than any man should have lived. My memories have grown deeper than the depths of the ocean. So vast that creatures unbeknownst to me swim its waters and threaten to consume me. Now I tread on the surface and wait to be taken. Twenty lives of men I have persisted. Through greed I have been able to persist. Now I exist as a pauper on the streets I would have ruled, unable to be taken by death. Implanted with the ability to survive and regenerate off of waste, light and air. Disimbued with the will to action. Would only that a better man had been given this gift. But he would not have taken it, he would not have stood on the backs of so many. I remember the earth. I remember that dying planet with so many souls. In our greats effort, our greatest virtue we built the ships which would then build the sphere. Autonomous, implacable, infinite. We watched as they took apart our solar system, as the took apart our home and built something else. Something new, something far grander. From the darkness and the gutters we looked up and saw the glory they had constructed. And the greed came out from our bones. And we took the sphere for ourselves and let the rest to die, but necessity is the heart of innovation. We were knocked from our thrones. Our cities obliterated. Now rents into the velvety infinite. So much was lost. So much. However the sphere persists on, perhaps it has always existed and my earth was but a fragment of the sphere. A manifestation. But no this world is now too dying, just as my world was dying. The infinite has once again become too small a place.</p>

<p>-Recombinant Beggar</p>

<p>We have lost the skill to make what has been made. I make a computer or a hammer and in time it fades into the parts it is made of. It has no life of its own, it has no persistence. The sphere is made of similar parts, but they have some other nature. No mechanic fixes the sphere when broken, how could one fix the infinite? Each part, a whole, each part the result of another. Always replaced, always irreplaceable. A form that remains though the whole is in flux. Like a whirlpool in a river or a man. The substance changes but the form remains the same. How might I impart such a form on the universe. Moreover, how might this form be useful to my ends? Perhaps could do this I would be a god, but I am told it was not the gods who made the sphere. Perhaps we once knew we were gods but now the knowledge is lost to us. I do not know. I do know that every expedition into the bowels of the sphere brings something I do not understand. There is much we have lost.</p>
