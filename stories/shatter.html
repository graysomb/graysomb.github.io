    <h1>Shatter</h1>
<p>We shall sit upon these shifting sands and I will tell the tale of how time was shattered by the hands of mortal man. Long ago the world was not wrought of deserts and sands, but of things green and living. Man lived with these things, but not in harmony. He tread them down, bade them his bidding, and burned them if they did not yield. One by one he conquered the forces of the world. Chained them to his ever growing throne. Fire was the first, harnessing it for warmth and destruction. Then the motion of the waters to both move upon and mechanize with. The animals of the land harnessed and culled. Then he looked inwards. He saw the wild animal that existed in his own mind and chained him too. Little was left of the fundamental forces of the world. No longer their own, but mere extensions of his will. He then turned his attention to the great leviathan of space itself. With fire and water, with the metals of the earth he wrought great machines. Machines that bent and molded the distances between places. He had struck down space and made its fabric as flexible as a bolt of silk. The declination of distances was now his to decide.</p>

<p>Man’s brow had grown heavy with crowns. His hand too weak to raise his many rings. Chaos had snuck in; seeped into his heart and mind. The forces that willed himself into existence had been chained and could will him together no longer. He was old. The sturdier the empire the greater the surety it will crumble. In time. He saw that all his gaining, all his grabbing had been against but one force. The black maw that swallows all. The fire that burns without flames, without air: rocks, metals, people, ideas. The slow inevitable, interminable, sliding of all objects into nothingness: time.</p>

<p>It was time that was the last great foe of man. Time that wore the will down. Time that made wine sour and food rotten. Time that made mockeries of love. Time that ripped life from our bones. What is gain and loss in a world without time? What is to live and to die. Merely reflections of each other in time’s mirror. With man’s last strength he dammed the river of time. He built pools and canals. Carving out unseen channels with unseen hands. Reweaving the tapestry of time. Circular paths on which he could forever flow. Ponds of paradise, never beginning never ending. The same stories are eternally retold. Man again was young, he was immortal. his reign supreme.</p>

<p>But time is not just a fluid that flows. The infinite order of the paradise man had made was the very fuel that time sought to burn. The entire universe was pent up, waiting for something unexpected, for a spark. It is the nature of the universe for the unprecedented to occur. We cannot know the exact cause of the shattering, but we know its outline. Perhaps a single atom was allowed to behave spontaneously for a single moment. That was enough to ignite everything. A cascade of chaos through man’s order. A joyful shredding of reality’s flesh. The unseen walls of the possibility, the physical laws that bound the cosmos, were torn like wet paper. Realities undreamt of mixed and roiled. Time flowed in torrents, forwards, backwards, and perpendicular to both. Vortices of time, loops of time. Present, past and possibility commingling.</p>

<p>It no longer means anything to speak of when this happened. It has happened, it is happening, and it is not. I was born, I will live and I will die. But not once, not in that order. Many, many times. Yet we still live on, if you can define living in a world in which time is as fickle as the wind. Now only the most desolate and unchanging places in the world are safe: deserts, oceans, icy plains. Still great storms of time may carry you into places long past, or possibilities unimagined. Is there any meaning to life’s actions, one’s will to survive, in a place without time? Do not answer me. We walk on and in walking journey farther than any man has before us. We are sailors on a mercurial sea. With no home forward and no home behind.</p>

<p>Perhaps, perhaps we can navigate these labyrinths of time. Perhaps we can learn the secrets of our grandfathers and grandsons. Speak to them, learn from them and in distant times, in distant worlds we may find a place where time’s fury has forgotten the sins of man. I pray that this will happen before my dissolution, but deep down hope is just the mind begging for mercy.</p>
