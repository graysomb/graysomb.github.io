    <h1>The God's Crypt</h1>
<p>I have seen a thousand worlds burn. Dashed like eggs against rocks. These hands, who only remember omnipotence, now can do naught but end my own life. I am suspended as a mote in a vast enveloping darkness. I drift as the so many distant masses about me. Reduced to their form of existence. Stars, endless stars. I have counted them, yet I cannot bring them all into the realm of my thoughts. I do not experience time, there is no change in this purgatory. The internal chronometer registers four months. I am kept alive by a seething mass of tentacles piercing the cells of my body keeping them in stasis. Before I was locked in this... prison, I was kept from food and water. But I am accustomed to hunger. All those worlds and it was never enough, never enough for the old hunger. Do you not feel it? It is in our bones.</p>

<p>The ebb and flow of my matter is powered by a spinning mass of thorium, a wheel of life. It gives no satiation. It never has. There is a siren that I cannot hear blaring across the years, or across the parsecs, these are not different. If a passing ship captures these whispers I will be taken aboard. This is my hope and my despair. Space is empty. It is the great void. I might live all the cycles of the thorium fuel cell, a millennium, and still find no one. But is it not the void in which all things come. Is it not the great chance maker? The chalice of all that is. I think on these things and wait.</p>

<p>Time has passed, yet I do not flow with its course. I exist in a place without time. A thought can last a second or a year. Is there not a finite amount of thoughts, a finite amount of things? When shall I think that final thought? Perhaps it has already occurred and I have forgotten. No, that is a path that I shall not take. A day will come when I think the last thought. I will understand the universe. I will understand the intimate and secret laws of the universe. I will express them not in an infinite concatenation, but in a single thought. One thought, absolute fullness.</p>

<p>With a sufficient fulcrum and lever one may move a planet. I shall move the universe. Through contemplation we may determine cause and effect. I have spent one hundred years in contemplation. I know the times and places in which the movement of my finger would cause a ship to enter my space. The motion of air, the vibrations of metal, the patter of hydrogen, the dull roar of the void. Causality traveling faster than light. A ship will come. If my ears could catch all the sounds of the universe I would hear the breath of its crew.</p>

<p>In this moment of knowing, knowing the time and place of my salvation, I experience a vertigo. Why should I be limited to this reality? I whose hands have dipped into the infinite and woven with the strings of the universe. The universe is a dream whose plot I could control. A dream not confined to my mind.</p>

<p>Free to experience any reality I experienced one most familiar to me. The one I had dreamt the last one hundred years. I dreamt the ship. I dreamt my return to my armies and the conquest of the galaxy. Upon my death I willed my return to my prison. Darkness enveloped my vision. Darkness pricked by stars. I felt the coursing of the life systems, I heard the low hum of the thorium core. I am at the fulcrum.</p>

<p>For one hundred years I had beaten my brain against the walls of this prison, the walls of this universe. Now I have broken through. My mind is reality. My contemplations are matter. I could dream any universe I wanted.</p>

<p>I dreamt a hundred lives of pleasure. To once again know pleasure I dreamt a hundred lives of pain. My dreams became wilder. I dreamt of being other men, other beings, forgetting I was the dreamer. I dreamt I launched a thousand wooden ships to take back my wife who had been stolen from me. I dreamt that I was that very wife. I dreamt I traveled to a dry land to fight for my gods. I dreamt I defended that very same land. I dreamt of forests, deserts of sand and ice, rivers, oceans. I lived out the lives of men and women living in each. I was and am all possible beings. As all possible beings I dreamt all possible dreams. I was even you, dreaming this dream.</p>

<p>I returned to my original reality as one returning home. Of all the universes I have dreamt of this one the most. It is only in this reality that I will break through the last wall of this cosmos.</p>

<p>This ends the life of General C. H. Brahm, jettisoned in a life pod after the mutiny of his crew. The time of expiration was 112 years from launch. His thought patterns serve as an intimate record of the longest conscious space flight in history. The cause of death was the simultaneous fragmentation of DNA in all cells.</p>
